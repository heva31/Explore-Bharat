      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>The City Palace of Jaipur, located in the heart of the Pink City in Rajasthan, India, is a magnificent
        architectural marvel that reflects the grandeur and heritage of the region's royal history. Built in the 18th
        century by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, the City Palace is a fusion of Rajput, Mughal,
        and European architectural styles. Over the centuries, subsequent rulers of the Kachwaha dynasty made additions
        and modifications, enriching the palace's aesthetic and historical significance.</p>
      <p>
        The construction of the City Palace began in 1729 and continued over several generations, with each ruler
        leaving their mark on the palace complex. The palace served as the seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur and the
        administrative center of the kingdom. It also housed various royal functions, ceremonies, and court proceedings,
        showcasing the opulence and power of the Rajput rulers.</p>
