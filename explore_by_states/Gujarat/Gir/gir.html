      <h2>HISTORY</h2>

      The area of Gir National Park was once the hunting ground for the Britishers during their reign in
      India and while hunting these great numbers of tigers and lions accompanied by several Rajas and
      Maharajas of the region, it was considered as the matter of great pride. It was in the year 1899,
      the major counts of lions decreased sharply with the effect of famine and as a result Lord Curzon
      cancelled his trip in Gir which was scheduled for shooting upon invitation by the nawabs of the region.
      The effect of famine was so great that Lord Curzon even advised the residents of the area to save the
      remaining lions.

      <h2>Wildlife in Gir National Park Forest</h2>

      <p id="content">
        The land of the Asiatic lion is the ideal reserve for the tremendous varieties of wild creatures to
        roam freely and safely. To make a royal journey towards the grand rugged hills of Sasan Gir, the
        wildlife lovers can get a fabulous opportunity to witness around 2,375 distinct fauna species of Gir
        to include around 38 species of mammals, 300 species of birds, 37 species of reptiles and more than
        2,000 species of insects.
        <br><br>
        The group of the carnivores in Gir is truly comprised of the presence of Asiatic lions, Indian Leopards,
        Indian Cobras, Sloth bears, Jungle cats, Golden Jackals, Indian Palm Civets, Striped Hyenas,
        Indian Mongoose and Ratels. Desert cats and Rusty-spotted cats exist but can be rarely seen.
        <br><br>
        The main herbivores genres of the residents of Gir are Chital, Nilgai (or Blue bull), Antelope,
        Sambar, Four-horned Chinkara and Wild boar. Blackbucks from the surrounding area can be occasionally
        identified in the sanctuary.
        <br><br>
        The group of smaller mammals will also include Porcupine and Hare where Pangolin is rare in
        Gir sanctuary. The reptiles are represented by the Marsh crocodile hir Tortoise and the Monitor
        Lizard in the water areas of the sanctuary. Snakes and Pythons too can be found in the lush bushes
        and along the streams. Being adopted under the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project in 1977,
        the Gujarat State Forest Department has used the reserve area where the area is also flourished
        with more than 300 species of birds. The scavenger group of birds has 6 recorded species of Vultures.
        Some of the typical species of Gir include Crested Serpent Eagle, Brown Fish Owl, Crested Hawk-eagle,
        endangered Bonelli's Eagle, Rock Bush-Quail, Indian Eagle-Owl, Black-headed Oriole, Pygmy Woodpecker,

      <h2>Safari Timing</h2>

      <p id="content">
        In Gir, most of the area is comprised of rugged hills, with high ridges and densely forested valleys,
        wide grassland plateaus, and isolated hilltops. Around half of the forested area of the park is being
        stuffed with teak forest, with other floral varieties like khair, dhavdo, timru, amla, and many others.
        The other half is non-teak forest, with samai, simal, khakhro and asundro jambu, umro, amli, vad and
        kalam; mostly broadleaf and evergreen trees. The river Hiran is the only one to flow year-round; with
        rest of the inflows being seasonal. There are also areas of the park with open scrub and savannah-type
        of grassland.
        To have a fantastic safari experience at Sasan Gir, the privilege of jeep safari with an assistance of
        a guide is beneficial. The Gir Forest Department also organizes "Lion Shows" for much fun.
        They make sure that you can see the lions at close range so they send trackers early morning on a
        mission to the located places and tempt them with live baits.
